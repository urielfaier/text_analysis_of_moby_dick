# R Text Analysis for Moby Dick

This project involves analyzing the text of Herman Melville's classic novel, Moby Dick, using the R programming language. Through a series of analytical tasks, we aim to uncover insights into the text structure, word frequencies, and chapter patterns.

## Project Objectives

Our main objectives include:

1. **Data Acquisition:** Extracting the text of Moby Dick from the Gutenberg project and preparing it for analysis.
2. **Word Frequency Analysis:** Analyzing the distribution of word lengths, computing word frequencies, and identifying the most common words in the text.
3. **Chapter Structure Examination:** Analyzing the chapter structure of Moby Dick, including word counts per chapter, and identifying significant patterns or themes.

## Files

- `Text Analysis for Moby Dick.Rmd`: R Markdown script containing the analysis code.
- `README.md`: This README file providing an overview of the project.
